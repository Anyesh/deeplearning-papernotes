A DAVIS 16 data user here. The idea is simple, unsupervised video object segmentation. Given a video segment out the object of interest. The design is threefold: 1) use a classic CNN for object segmentation at each frame, 2) use a motion segmentation CNN to predict what moved in the scene, and 3) use a bidirectional convolutional GRU to add the information of these two up. It ends up with an okay IOU (75). Cool paper.
