A great little paper out of FAIR and UW. It implements image detection using an end to end CNN that can work in real time. The base of the network is basically GoogLeNet. The network then spits out two things: bounding box proposals and a class probability map. The class probability map is a 7x7x20 (20 classes) grid that estimates the class at each of the 49 locations corresponding the regions in the image. Any bounding box proposal in that area will be associated with that class. The bounding box proposals are 5 tuples for each location (thus occupy a 7x7x5 grid of outputs). The five elements are x, y, w, h and the confidence. Thus if outputting a single bounding box proposal per grid element the network will have a total of 7x7x25 outputs.

What I love about this system is the relative simplicity compared to _ RCNN. And while the actual performance is not as good in the end, I would prefer to build on top of this system than the other.
