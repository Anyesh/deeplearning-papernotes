Okay I really like this. This one again throws away multi scale and sliding and instead does instance segmentation with a single CNN pass. The way they do it is they train their network to recognize watershed energy (basically distance from the edges). And then they apply a simple watershed technique to the top. I love the idea, and hope this starts to take over all SOTA approaches.
