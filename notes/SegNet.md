Segnet has a very simple idea. First note that it competes against deep lab, which is fairly complex, mainly because of the two parts CNN and CRF. Segnet shows that by remembering the indices from pooling, and then depooling based on those indices you can achieve the same results. I do think that the paper is missing some things (dilated convolutions and a resnet base), but a good result to tuck into the hat.
