Cycle gan. I feel like I am writing this up pretty late. But the idea is pretty simple. We are trying to map images of one domain into images in another domain (winter to summer/simulation to real). We train two gans simultaneously. One that will map from A to B back to A and one from B to A to B. The first step is penalized with a discriminator and the second is penalized with cycle consistency loss (think L2 or perceptual loss). Works for color and texture, does not work otherwise (think geometric transformations).
