I like the initial idea of the paper. Sometimes when we get bounding boxes they are not necessarily capturing the whole image. So instead of just doing instance segmentation inside the bounding box, we will predict something different. We will predict what the distance is to the edge of the object. That way we can expand the segmentation and the bounding box as needed. Now this is a fine idea and all, but the final network turned into a cascade of region proposal networks, bounding box expanders and classifiers. I like the idea, I wish they took it from the ground up.
