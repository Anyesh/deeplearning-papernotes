A pretty cool almost application based paper. The idea is incredibly simple. We will create some distance measure for 3d shapes. We will then embed these shapes to persevere this distance measure (take your pick of embedding tools). Then you will train a CNN to take generated images (generated with the aforementioned shapes) and map them near to their shape embedding. In such a way you can create an Image -> shape function and its inverse.
