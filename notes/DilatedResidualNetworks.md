Another Fisher Yu, and this one is a really good one. The entire idea is they apply dilated convolutions to a resnet and have great performance gains without increasing the number of parameters in the network. They show it works on classification, localization and semantic segmentation to great effect. They have a small section on degridding (Colah does a nice blog article on this). And they verify all their claims with simple effective experiments. This is what al papers should aspire towards.
