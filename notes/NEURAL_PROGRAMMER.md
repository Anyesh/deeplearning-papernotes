A Sutskever and Quoc Le one. This one is a bit in depth. The basic idea here is you train a network to do some simple queries over a table. At each step the network figures out which column to run over and which operation to perform. It records a history (RNN) of what it has already done and it always conditions on an embedded question. The results are not so good. While it is a cool architecture, it is certainly a toy one.
