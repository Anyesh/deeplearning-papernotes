Tarr (associate of Pinker) and Bulthoff propose a new theory of object recognition by combining image based and structural decomposition models.

Previous models by Marr et al. argued that object representations should be stable, and thusly object-centered rather than viewer-centered. Biederman concretized this theory with his Paper, 'Recognition-By-Components'. Despite the strong theoretical underpinning, the data seemed to imply that that humans rely on image based representations that are viewpoint dependent. However even these models failed to provided well specified mechanism for class level recognition (a dog is an animal). Thus there needed to be a reconciliation between the two.

The problems are below:

* First there needed to reconcile the spectrum of result measuring the viewpoint dependency in object recognition
* Second, humans are capable of recognizing objects at multiple categorical levels.
* Third, Humans vary in level of expertise
* And finally, the overall performance in a given task is a product of a complex interaction between all of those factors.

Their solution is:

* There is interpolation across views and class exemplars in image based models
* There are temporal associations
* There is explicit (silhouette) and implicit (spacial relations between local features) structural information
