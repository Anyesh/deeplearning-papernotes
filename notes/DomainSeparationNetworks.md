This is a bit more complex than other domain adaptation papers. As typical of these papers it wants there to be a similarity between features extracted from the simulated and target images and it wants a network to preform well on these features, but it adds one more step in the process. It uses those features to reconstruct the original image as well (but that reconstruction can also use some private features of the simulated/real images)!
