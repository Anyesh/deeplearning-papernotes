This guys is pretty simple packaged up in something a little too complex. The main idea is to use multi view information instead of 3d models to enhance image recognition. They do this by either data augmentation (train a network with multiple views of the same object), or at test time by pooling the features of many CNNs applied at different views. Yep that is mostly it. There are details in implementation and shape retrieval in the paper, but I will leave them to the reader to find out.
