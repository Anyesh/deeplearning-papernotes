A Fei Fei paper. So this one is pretty hacky in more than one ways, like really a cobbling together of techniques: SVMs, CNNs, RCNNs, Grabcut, optimization. Iâ€™ll cut to the chase, the results are nice. You are able to get key points from bounding boxed images (that are easily segmented from the background), but it is questionable whether this will work elsewhere because of the high amount of customization of the model and its parts.
