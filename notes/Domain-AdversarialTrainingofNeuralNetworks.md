Quite a long paper with some theoretical results that are quite interesting, but the real contribution comes from the experiments that verify these results. The experiments are quite simple in fact. They propose to do domain adaptation by ensuring the features extracted with a CNN trunk from the simulated images have the same distribution as those from real images. They do this using adversarial learning.
